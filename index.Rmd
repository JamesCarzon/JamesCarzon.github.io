## James Carzon

#### Doctoral student
#### Department of Statistics and Data Science
#### Carnegie Mellon University

I entered the statistics Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon University in 2021. 
I'm currently working on my Advanced Data Analysis project, an applied project 
as part of the program; the object is to quantify uncertainty in the solution 
to a non-linear, ill-posed inverse problem where the forward model is a climate 
simulation and the quantities whose inference is our interest are unknown 
physical parameters. My mentors are Mikael Kuusela (Statistics and Data 
Science) and Hamish Gordon (Chemical Engineering).

This is an example of a non-academic thing that I do.

## About my website

On this site, I present my resum\'{e}, broadly construed, including academic 
and recreational trivia. I also blog on various topics, academic ones beyond 
the above link and non-academic ones at https://nothalfgood.wordpress.com/.

This website behaves as an example of what a person can achieve from the 
comfort of RStudio, but I am still only incrementally improving my website. It 
is not rude to let me know if the site is not accessible or otherwise presents 
itself in an unsitely manner. [I assume that] you can borrow template content 
from my website for your own use by consulting my Github repo; I, in turn, 
followed the useful guidance on the [Crump Lab's website](https://crumplab.com/LabJournalWebsite/index.html).

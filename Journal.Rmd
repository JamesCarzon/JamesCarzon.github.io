## 24 August 2021

I am setting about writing content for my personal website for a few reasons. 
First, this is an exercise of tools in which I may need to become more 
fluent. For example, I have not often used GitHub in undergrad, and so now I am 
using it a fair amount for setting up my site. I am also a little bit rusty in 
R, so now I am refreshing my memory of the language.

Second, I want to have a long term location for consistent writing. I am happy 
to write blog posts on the occasion that I find a topic which fits the purview 
of the blog, but I also found keeping a research-and-work journal helpful when 
working on projects so that I can remember the big ideas that I would otherwise 
forget while studying very small ideas. With the commencement of my graduate 
studies - and more projects on which to work than ever - this journal shall be 
my blessing and curse.

As should be clear enough, this "Journal" serves a different purpose than does 
my blog. This is not the place for me to document each original idea I have. 
Instead, I will record checkpoints in the projects on which I work. 
This includes the start or finish of a project and possibly publications and 
presentations. I will also record my motivations and the changes or 
developments to them.

For my GitHub Pages site, I have been writing all of my pages in RMarkdown with 
RStudio. [This page](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/rmarkdown_websites.html#overview) 
I found online (by Garrett Grolemund, I think) has been a useful resource. I 
have also benefitted from some videos by Matthew Crump on his YouTube channel, 
"Programming For Psychologists."
